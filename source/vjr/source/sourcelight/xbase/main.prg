* This document is released as Liberty Software under a Repeat License, as governed
* by the Public Benefit License v1.0 or later (PBL).
*
* The PBL is public domain license with a caveat:  self accountability unto God.
* You are free to use, copy, modify and share this software for any purpose, however,
* it is the desire of those working on this project that the software remain open.
* It is our request that you maintain it that way.  This is not a legal request unto
* our court systems, but rather a personal matter between you and God.  Our talents
* were received from God, and given to you through this forum.  And it is our wish
* that those talents reach out to as many as possible in a form allowing them to wield
* this content for their own betterment, as you are now considering doing.  And whereas
* we could've forced the issue through something like a copyleft-protected release, the
* truth is we are all giving an account of our lives unto God continually by the daily
* choices we make.  And here again is another case where you get to demonstrate your
* character unto God, and unto your fellow man.
*
* Jesus came to this Earth to set the captives free, to save men's eternal souls from
* the punishment demanded by our sin.  Each one of us is given the opportunity to
* receive Him in this world and be saved.  Whether we choose to receive Him, and follow
* Him, and purpose our lives on the goals He has for each of us (all of which are
* beneficial for all involved), is one way we reveal our character continually.  God
* sees straight through to the heart, bypassing all of the words, all of the facades.
* He is our Creator, and He knows who we are truly.
*
* Jesus is called "Christ" because He saves men from the eternal flames of Hell, the
* just punishment of rebellion against God (rebellion against truth) by eternal beings,
* which each of us are.
*
* Do not let His free gift escape you because of some desire to shortcut what is right
* in your life. Instead, do what is right, and do it because He is who He is, and what
* He has done to save us from such a fate.  Demonstrate to Him, to me, and to all of
* mankind, and to all of the Heavenly hosts, exactly who you are on the inside.  Receive
* Jesus Christ into your heart, learn of Him, of how He came here to guide us into that
* which is of His Kingdom and will be forever hereafter we leave this world.  Do this,
* and live.

* Thank you.  And may The Lord bless you richly as you lift up your life, your
* talents, your gifts, your praise, unto Him.  In Jesus' name I pray.  Amen.
